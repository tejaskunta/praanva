Hello guys, we are teaem code busters as first years from Kmit.

## how the app works
Moving to the working of the app, i have a main dart which obviously connects all the screens of the app together

SCREENS
---
so we have 8 total screens, and first lets taslk about the splash screen as it is the first. We used an inbuilt icon in flutter for the app icon and added a nice animation to it by makng it expand and smooth go to the next page.

Next is the login, and we add a field for the college the student goes to and also added normal gmail and password option, but it stated as the user can use any anonymous gmail that is not connect to them.

#home screen
next we have home screen witha  app drawer that has mental health hotlies and numbers
it has the main stress assessment test button and also the chat room button 
in the top right we have an option for the therapists to access their chat with the students
#this is in the therapist_mode_screen

so the chatroom button leads to the chat room with the therapist in home and the take assessment button takes them to the stress assessment 

# in stress_result_screen
after the student finsidhes the test, he is shown his score and give particular exercises for his stress level

so he is provided breathing or a CBT exercises
and next he is sent to 
#exercise_screen and there is the specific exercise here for the student and there is a specific exercise for each stress level and incase of very high stress there is a hotline as well
