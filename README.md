# Praanva - Anonymous Mental Health & Meditation App

Praanva is an anonymous mental health app designed to help students face mental health challenges without fear of judgment or stigma.

## Problem We’re Solving

Many students struggle with mental health but avoid seeking help because they are afraid of being judged. Praanva solves this by providing a private and anonymous space where students can assess their stress levels, get help through proven exercises, and talk to therapists anonymously.

## How the App Works

The app starts with a stress assessment. Students answer a few simple questions based on scientific stress scales. After completing the test, the app will calculate the student’s stress level.

Based on the results, the app provides different coping exercises. These exercises are chosen according to the student’s stress level. High-stress students are given deep breathing exercises or guided meditation. Students with moderate stress are recommended grounding techniques or diaphragmatic breathing. Those with low stress are provided positive affirmations and light breathing exercises. 

The exercises are made on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) methods.

Once the exercise is complete, students can enter an anonymous chatroom. In this chatroom, they can talk directly to therapists assigned by their school. The chat is fully anonymous and therapists are only shown as online when available.

The app also has a small app bar in home screeen where students can access mental health hotline numbers in case of emergencies.

## App Features

## Tech Stack

The app is built using Flutter and Dart for cross-platform development, allowing it to run on both Android and iOS device. We use local state management and a local database to store data and manage app flow. For future scaling, we plan to integrate Firebase for authentication, database storage, and push notifications.

The UI/UX includes Lottie animations and timer widgets for smooth user interaction, especially during exercises. The app also uses an AI-based algorithm powered by OpenAI API to detect patterns of stress and suggest coping mechanisms.

## Scaling and Future Plans

We aim to scale Praanva to more colleges and schools, allowing more students to access anonymous mental health support. Future versions will fully integrate Firebase for real-time chat, notifications, and better analytics.

## Scientific Stress Assessment Scales Used

We based our stress assessment on the following scientifically validated scales:

- Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): https://www.apa.org
- DASS-21: https://www2.psy.unsw.edu.au/dass/
